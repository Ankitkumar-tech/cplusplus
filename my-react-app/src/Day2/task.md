### Practical Assignment: **Counter App with Props and State**

#### **Objective:**
Create a React application with the following features:
1. A **Counter** component that displays:
   - The current count value.
   - Two buttons: **Increment** and **Decrement** to update the count.
2. A **Parent Component**:
   - Passes the initial value of the count as a prop to the Counter component.
   - Displays the current count below the Counter component.

---

#### **Requirements:**
1. **Props**: Use props to pass the initial count from the parent component to the Counter component.
2. **State**: Manage the count state in the Counter component.
3. **Event Handling**: Use event handlers for incrementing and decrementing the count.
4. **Validation**: Ensure the count does not go below 0.
5. **Styling**: Add some basic CSS styling to make the UI look neat.

---

#### **Example UI:**
```
Initial Count: 10
---------------------
Current Count: 10

[ Increment ]  [ Decrement ]
```

#### **Deliverables:**
- Submit the code for both the **Parent Component** and the **Counter Component**.
