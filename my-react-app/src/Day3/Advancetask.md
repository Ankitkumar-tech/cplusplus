Here's a breakdown of what you need to do for each page to complete the **Enhanced Task Manager App**:

---

### **1. App.jsx**
This is the central point of your application. You’ll manage the global state for tasks and pass it to other components.

#### **Tasks for App.jsx:**
- **Centralize State**:
  - Store tasks as an array of objects:
    ```jsx
    const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([
      { id: 0, name: "Learn React", completed: false, priority: "High", createdAt: new Date() },
    ]);
    ```
  - Each task should have:
    - `id`: Unique identifier.
    - `name`: Task name.
    - `completed`: Boolean for completion status.
    - `priority`: Task priority (High, Medium, Low).
    - `createdAt`: Timestamp for when the task was created.

- **Routing**:
  - Pass `tasks` and `setTasks` to these components:
    - `Homepage`: To add, delete, mark as completed, edit, and sort tasks.
    - `TaskDetailsPage`: To display individual task details.
    - `AboutPage`: No tasks required here.

---

### **2. Homepage.jsx**
This is the main task management interface where users can interact with their tasks.

#### **Tasks for Homepage.jsx:**
1. **Add Tasks**:
   - Input field and a dropdown for priority selection.
   - Add new tasks to the `tasks` array in `App.jsx`.

2. **Mark as Completed**:
   - Add a "Mark as Completed" button next to each task.
   - Update the `completed` field for the task when clicked.

3. **Edit Tasks**:
   - Add an "Edit" button next to each task.
   - When clicked:
     - Show an input field to update the task name.
     - Save the changes on "Enter" or a "Save" button.

4. **Delete Tasks**:
   - Add a "Delete" button to remove tasks from the `tasks` array.

5. **Sort by Priority**:
   - Display tasks sorted dynamically:
     - High → Medium → Low.

6. **Search Tasks**:
   - Add a search bar to filter tasks dynamically by their name.

---

### **3. TaskDetailsPage.jsx**
This page displays detailed information about a specific task.

#### **Tasks for TaskDetailsPage.jsx:**
1. **Fetch Task Data**:
   - Use the `id` from the URL (`useParams`) to find the task in the `tasks` array.

2. **Display Task Details**:
   - Show:
     - Task Name.
     - Completion Status (Completed/Not Completed).
     - Priority Level.
     - Date and time the task was created (`createdAt`).

3. **Navigation**:
   - Add a "Back to Homepage" link to return to the homepage.

---

### **4. AboutPage.jsx**
This is a static page explaining the purpose of the app.

#### **Tasks for AboutPage.jsx:**
1. Add a short description of the app:
   - Example: "This app helps users manage their tasks efficiently, with features like priority sorting and task editing."

2. Add navigation links to Home and Task Details.
