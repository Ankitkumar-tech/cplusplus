# High-Level Language vs Low-Level Language

1. **High-Level Language** and **Low-Level Language** are types of programming languages. The main difference between the two lies in their level of abstraction:

   - **High-Level Language**: Programmers can easily understand, interpret, or compile these languages. They are closer to human language and easier to work with compared to machines.
   - **Low-Level Language**: Machines can easily understand these languages, but they are more challenging for human beings to comprehend.

2. **Is C++ a High-Level Language?**

   Yes, **C++** is generally considered a high-level programming language. It offers:
   - A relatively human-readable syntax.
   - Support for complex data structures.
   - The ability to perform abstraction.

   At the same time, C++ allows interaction with low-level hardware when necessary, making it a versatile language that bridges the gap between high and low levels.
